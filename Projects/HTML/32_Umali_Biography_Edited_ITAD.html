      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>When I was a kid, I really like eating a lot. By eating a lot will only make me stop crying.<sup>1</sup>
      I went to Santo Nino Parish School when I was in Nursery.<sup>2</sup> I didn't cry when my mom left me on my own on the first day of my school.<sup>3</sup>
      I had a lot of fun on that day because I made a lot of friends during that day.<sup>4</sup> I've only cry when I am hungry or I am sick.<sup>5</sup>
      I skipped kinder and proceeded to grade 1and studied at San Benildo near Antipolo City.<sup>6</sup> I didn't have great memories when I was grade 1, all I remembered is that I was always bullied and picked on,
      but I always fight back so that they won't bother me again.<sup>7</sup> After a year passed I now became a grade 2 student and is still studying in San Benildo.<sup>8</sup>
      I've met a lot of friends in my new class, we always hang out at the canteen or at the library.<sup>9</sup> We sometimes tell each other scary stories before going back to class.<sup>10</sup>
      We went to field trips which I can't remember the details about it.<sup>11</sup> Then a book fare was held at our school, we were so excited because they are selling toys and new books.<sup>12</sup>
      I was jealous of my classmates because they can purchase those things while I can't.<sup>13</sup> But it's fine because I know that we are not rich and can only afford so little.<sup>14</sup>
      Then another year passed and now I am a grade 3 student.<sup>15</sup> That year, there was a trend where kids all over the classroom goes "wow" about it.<sup>16</sup>
      When I checked it out, I saw those awesome Pokemon Trading Cards.<sup>17</sup> I really love Pokemon, it was literally the greatest game and everyone is going crazy about it.<sup>18</sup>
      The one that I remembered the most is when my uncle gave me and my brother a "Game Boy".<sup>19</sup>
      It really meant a lot to us because it was a really fun gadget and we can now play Pokemon with it.<sup>20</sup></b>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>When I am in grade 4, I transferred to a school named "Magis Academy".<sup>1</sup>
        The reason why I transferred is because my parents think that I am not learning anything in my previous school.<sup>2</sup>
        It was pretty awkward because I am new to this school and I really don't know anyone.<sup>3</sup> I can say that the people working at that school are nice people.<sup>4</sup>
        At that time, I saw a beautiful girl in my class and I was actually awe spired and breathless.<sup>5</sup> She was smart, kind and gentle too.<sup>6</sup>
        I admired her and because of that, I studied really hard so that I could be on the same level as her. I've reached the top students in my class.
        I was in top 5 while she was in top 2, because of this I've decided to study harder so I could aim higher.<sup>7</sup> After studying for a year, I am now a grade 5 student.<sup>8</sup>
        Nothing happened that much when I was in grade 5, all I remembered is that we studied till' we can't study no more.<sup>9</sup> Now I am a grade 6 and is now about to graduate middle school.<sup>10</sup>
        I kept studying pretty hard but it didn't pay off. When I was called up the stage, I didn't have honors.<sup>11</sup>
        I was sad because I've been studying all this time for nothing, but that didn't bring me down.<sup>12</sup> I've decided that when I became a grade 7 student, I will study harder.<sup>13</sup>
        Nothing much happened when I became a grade 7 - 8 student.<sup>14</sup> When I was a grade 9 student, there I met my true friends, till' today we're still friends.<sup>15</sup>
        We played this so called card game "Cardfight Vanguard", it was a really fun card game where you have to fight your opponent and get them to 6 damages.<sup>16</sup>
        Of course I was the best player among my friends but that didn't stop them from becoming a better duelist.<sup>17</sup>
        Because of this, we study during day time and play Cardfight Vanguard during dismissal period.<sup>18</sup>
        This routine kept going for the whole year and after that we are now in grade 10 and is now a graduating student.<sup>19</sup> This time I met new more friends and is fond of playing Cardfight Vanguard with us.<sup>20</sup>
        My friends at that time are like brothers from another mother.<sup>21</sup> We had a lot of fun during that time, we help each other when times of need, and we enjoy the company of each other.<sup>22</sup>
        The year ended all of us going up the stage and getting a diploma.<sup>23</sup></b>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>I am now a grade 11 student and is now currently enrolled in University of the East.<sup>1</sup>
        The reason why I transferred schools is that my previous school doesn't have a K - 12 curriculum.<sup>2</sup>
        I was supposed to enroll at University of Santo Thomas but we don't have the money to pay for the tuition.<sup>3</sup>
        It was really expensive so I tried other schools and ended up in University of the East.<sup>4</sup> I was actually nervous because it's a fresh start and I don't know anyone at all.<sup>5</sup>
        I was lost as I was finding my room.<sup>6</sup> I accidentally entered the wrong room which was really embarrassing.<sup>7</sup>
        The guard told me to go to the faculty room to update my registration form and so I did that.<sup>8</sup> When I finally got into my classroom, there were a lot of people from different schools.<sup>9</sup>
        I was a low key student, not looking for trouble and not looking for attention.<sup>10</sup>
        I met some decent friends but I was an introvert and decided to stay at the back of the room and listen to music.<sup>11</sup>
        This happened for the whole year and I'm okay with it.<sup>12</sup> After that year, I now became a grade 12 student.<sup>13</sup>
        This is the year where we are going to graduate from Senior High School and I was actually not that excited.<sup>14</sup>
        This year was like hell, a lot of projects needed to be submitted, a lot of quizzes and seatwork happened, and most importantly our thesis defense happened.
        It really was a stressful year for me that I almost collapsed from exhaustion.<sup>15</sup> Even after all of that, I managed to get high grades with a lot of effort and sheer determination.<sup>16</sup>
        When we are on the day of graduation, I felt relief because I have done everything I can in order to walk up on that stage and get my diploma.<sup>17</sup>
        The graduation ceremony took at least 1 to 2 hoursâ€™ maximum.<sup>18</sup> After the ceremony, my brother and my mom went out for dinner.<sup>19</sup>
        We were really hungry because food and beverages are not allowed inside the ceremony hall.<sup>20</sup>
        I am thankful that I managed to finish grade 12 without problems and that everything worked out just fine.<sup>21</sup>
        And there my life as a high school student ended and a new beginning just started.<sup>22</sup> After graduation, I enjoyed summer with my friends, go out of town with my family, etc.<sup>23</sup>
        Then college started.<sup>24</sup> I enrolled myself in Information Technology department and there I met new friends.<sup>25</sup>
        I first I thought that it was going to be hard but if you study really well you can pass all of the subjects.<sup>26</sup> I was not good at programming at first but I managed to get high grades.<sup>27</sup>
        First year was fun and our schedule is really amazing. We go to school at 7:00 AM and end our classes at 12:00 noon.<sup>28</sup></b>
