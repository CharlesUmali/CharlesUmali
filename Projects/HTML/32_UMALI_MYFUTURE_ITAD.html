      One of the very best reasons to become a computer programmer is the bounty of jobs out there. And because we are an increasingly technologically reliant society it is also apparent that there will be jobs in the programming sector for a long time to come. You can use your programming skills to compliment the work that you already do, or to follow a passion. For instance, if you are an accountant, you could write an accounting program that would make analysing accounts much easier. As a freelance programmer you can work wherever you want: at home in your pyjamas, in a hotel room while travelling the world, from your favourite café, or in your car after an early morning surf. You will be the person your friends turn to for tech advice. They will secretly be envious with the ease at which you are able to navigate the tech world, and with which you can master its difficulties. There is a saying that good programmers are lazy - meaning that good programmers find efficient ways of doing things so they don’t have to do extra work. In conclusion, I want to be a computer programmer because I enjoy designing games. I like playing video games and want to learn how to program my own. I already know a lot about programming and want to learn even more.

    <h2>I Want To Become a Millionaire</h2>

      I want to be a Millionaire because I want to be free of debt and financially independent. This reason for my desire for wealth predicates each and every other reason that I have.  It’s important here to not confuse being “in the money” with truly being wealthy.  So many people in the world appear to be wealthy but in reality are up to their knees in debt.  I don’t want this.  I want to be financially independent and by this I mean little to no debt and loads of cash or securities that are easily convertible to cash. Second is,  I want to have the power to choose to do anything I want to do. If I wake up one morning and have a great new idea for a product or a business I want to be able to act on it.  This will only be possible if I have the wealth necessary to do so.  This also applies to holidays and even education.  Some day I’d like to get a degree in electrical engineering.  I want to know how circuits and all of those complicated electronic (and computer) parts function.  Also I’d like to eventually see the world.  Unfortunately travel is expensive and unless I can achieve true wealth I might never accomplish this goal. Third is,  I want to be in a position to be able to support my parents. If my parents ever need help in their retirement (with medical or monetary things) I’d like to be in a position where I can support them.  They gave me everything that I ever needed for 18+ years of my life and I want to be able to return the favor.  Likewise I’d love it if I could be in a position to help my family members out in times of crisis. Lastly,  I want to be able to support my hobbies. Let’s face it, we all have hobbies that we wish we could support.  For me blogging is a hobby.  I wish I could do it more, but I have to work and go to school.  Of course there are also the less-productive hobbies.  I like to play with tech toys – my MacBook Pro, HD TV’s, etc.  These electronics are often quite expensive.  I also like to play video games occasionally and they cost money as well.

    <h2>I Want To Have a Family</h2>

      The reasons why I want to have a family because it gives me happiness. Happiness, true happiness that is, is something that is hard to come by for many people in this world; however, it is something that I have been blessed to have found in this life. Who gives me the happiness that the world so covets? My family—my husband and my daughter. My husband has this innate technique of making me laugh in the most appropriate circumstances—his silliness and my silliness have melded together in a way that makes our own unique language that no one else can understand. How do you define happiness? I define happiness as knowing that every day you will wake up next to your best friend and feel the little fingers of a human that you have given life to cutely poking your shoulder to remind you that, although it is Saturday, you still have to wake up early. Second is, it gives me comfort. When the world is weighing on your shoulders and you feel uncomfortable in your own skin, where do you find comfort? For me, there is only one place at home with my family. As soon as I lay one foot in the door and the air within my home hits my skin, I feel an instant relief of worries and doubts. An immediate sense of comfort overwhelms me. I cannot say that this is due to where I live but who I l ive with. Having a husband that greets me with a kiss and a smile when I walk in the door and a daughter whose whole countenance brightens by ten times when coming home brings me the sense that I am truly home  and comfortable like nowhere else. Third is, it gives me a place of belonging. While I was growing up, I remember feeling like I never fit in anywhere I can't say that I didn't feel comfortable at my parents' house but the sincere sense of belonging wasn't exactly there. At least, it can't compare to belonging to my own family now. When you have your own family, you are ultimately and indefinitely needed which is to say, you belong. It doesn't even matter if you feel innately different from your spouse or your children, because whether you know it or whether you want to admit it you are very much similar to your family. Think about it you wouldn't have gotten with your spouse if you didn't have something in common. And your kids?Well, they're just mini versions of us! So remember feeling like an outcast as a teenager? Well, when you have your own family you belong for good. (If you are a teenager reading this, you have something to look forward to! But for now, be happy and blessed that you have parents and siblings to enjoy!). Lastly, it gives me a feeling of safety. You know that feeling when you are wrapped up in a warm blanket on a cold winter's day, sitting on the couch and you feel as if nothing could harm you? That is not only a feeling of comfort, but a feeling of safety. Your family and the essence of your household provides a safety net like none other you will never need a security system again! Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration but you know what I mean.
