    <blockquote>
      When I was a kid, I really like eating a lot. By eating a lot will only make me stop crying.
      I went to Santo Nino Parish School when I was in Nursery. I didn't cry when my mom left me on my own on the first day of my school
      I had a lot of fun on that day because I made a lot of friends during that day. I've only cry when I am hungry or I am sick.
      I skipped kinder and proceeded to grade 1and studied at San Benildo near Antipolo City. I didn't have great memories when I was grade 1, all I remembered is that I was always bullied and picked on, but I always fight back so that they won't bother me again. After a year passed I now became a grade 2 student and is still studying in San Benildo. I've met a lot of friends in my new class, we always hang out at the canteen or at the library. We sometimes tell each other scary stories before going back to class. We went to field trips which I can't remember the details about it. Then a book fare was held at our school, we were so excited because they are selling toys and new books. I was jealous of my classmates because they can purchase those things while I can't. But it's fine because I know that we are not rich and can only afford so little. Then another year passed and now I am a grade 3 student. That year, there was a trend where kids all over the classroom goes "wow" about it. When I checked it out, I saw those awesome Pokemon Trading Cards. I really love Pokemon, it was literally the greatest game and everyone is going crazy about it. The one that I remembered the most is when my uncle gave me and my brother a "Game Boy". It really meant a lot to us because it was a really fun gadget and we can now play Pokemon with it.

    <blockquote>
      When I am in grade 4, I transferred to a school named "Magis Academy". The reason why I transferred is because my parents think that I am not learning anything in my previous school. It was pretty awkward because I am new to this school and I really don't know anyone. I can say that the people working at that school are nice people. At that time, I saw a beautiful girl in my class and I was actually awe spired and breathless. She was smart, kind and gentle too. I admired her and because of that, I studied really hard so that I could be on the same level as her. I've reached the top students in my class. I was in top 5 while she was in top 2, because of this I've decided to study harder so I could aim higher. After studying for a year, I am now a grade 5 student. Nothing happened that much when I was in grade 5, all I remembered is that we studied till' we can't study no more. Now I am a grade 6 and is now about to graduate middle school. I kept studying pretty hard but it didn't pay off. When I was called up the stage, I didn't have honors. I was sad because I've been studying all this time for nothing, but that didn't bring me down. I've decided that when I became a grade 7 student, I will study harder. Nothing much happened when I became a grade 7 - 8 student. When I was a grade 9 student, there I met my true friends, till' today we're still friends. We played this so called card game "Cardfight Vanguard", it was a really fun card game where you have to fight your opponent and get them to 6 damages. Of course I was the best player among my friends but that didn't stop them from becoming a better duelist. Because of this, we study during day time and play Cardfight Vanguard during dismissal period. This routine kept going for the whole year and after that we are now in grade 10 and is now a graduating student. This time I met new more friends and is fond of playing Cardfight Vanguard with us. My friends at that time are like brothers from another mother. We had a lot of fun during that time, we help each other when times of need, and we enjoy the company of each other. The year ended all of us going up the stage and getting a diploma.

    <blockquote>
      I am now a grade 11 student and is now currently enrolled in University of the East. The reason why I transferred schools is that my previous school doesn't have a K - 12 curriculum. I was supposed to enroll at University of Santo Thomas but we don't have the money to pay for the tuition. It was really expensive so I tried other schools and ended up in University of the East. I was actually nervous because it's a fresh start and I don't know anyone at all. I was lost as I was finding my room. I accidentally entered the wrong room which was really embarrassing.
      The guard told me to go to the faculty room to update my registration form and so I did that. When I finally got into my classroom, there were a lot of people from different schools. I was a low key student, not looking for trouble and not looking for attention. I met some decent friends but I was an introvert and decided to stay at the back of the room and listen to music. This happened for the whole year and I'm okay with it. After that year, I now became a grade 12 student. This is the year where we are going to graduate from Senior High School and I was actually not that excited. This year was like hell, a lot of projects needed to be submitted, a lot of quizzes and seatwork happened, and most importantly our thesis defense happened. It really was a stressful year for me that I almost collapsed from exhaustion. Even after all of that, I managed to get high grades with a lot of effort and sheer determination. When we are on the day of graduation, I felt relief because I have done everything I can in order to walk up on that stage and get my diploma. The graduation ceremony took at least 1 to 2 hoursâ€™ maximum. After the ceremony, my brother and my mom went out for dinner. We were really hungry because food and beverages are not allowed inside the ceremony hall. I am thankful that I managed to finish grade 12 without problems and that everything worked out just fine. And there my life as a high school student ended and a new beginning just started. After graduation, I enjoyed summer with my friends, go out of town with my family, etc. Then college started. I enrolled myself in Information Technology department and there I met new friends. I first I thought that it was going to be hard but if you study really well you can pass all of the subjects. I was not good at programming at first but I managed to get high grades. First year was fun and our schedule is really amazing. We go to school at 7:00 AM and end our classes at 12:00 noon.
