            <hr>
            <blockquote>Erected by a multinational team of engineers from 1922 to 1931, this art deco statue of Christ with arms outstretched watches over Brazil – and the world’s Christians – from the peak of Corcovado Mountain. At nearly two-thirds the size of the Statue of Liberty, the white soapstone and concrete work designed by Paul Landowski can be seen for miles and was selected as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Now the remains of an enormous, carved marble ellipse, the Colosseum was commissioned in A.D. 72 by Emperor Vespasian as an amphitheater to entertain the masses. Using four levels pierced by 80 arched entrances, 55,000 spectators could quickly take seats to watch all-day games between wild animals, slaves and criminals. The local guides in gladiator costumes hanging around today will tell you how the ground was once soaked in blood and that Christians, indeed, were thrown to lions here.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Located in the best place to visit in France, the Eiffel Tower sells about 7 million tickets annually and is appreciated at a distance by all Paris visitors. Completed for the 1889 Exposition Universelle after two years of construction, it has 1,665 steps to the top and elevators to two observation levels. Computer programmed beacons, which are seen up to 50 miles away, complement the tower's 20,000 lightbulbs as part of a thrilling, hourly night show designed to celebrate the millennium.</blockquote>

            <h4>Great Wall of China</h4>
            <hr>
            <blockquote>Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered the construction of the Great Wall in 221 B.C. to protect China’s first feudal empire from the Huns to the north. Eventually more than 5,500 miles long from east to west, a section built after the 14th century can be seen near Beijing. Skip the restored and crowded section at Badaling and join a tour to Jinshanling or Jiankou to hike between towers and turrets, the ever-snaking wall in view, and imagine the clatter of chariot hooves beneath your feet.</blockquote>

            <h4>Itsukushima Shrine, Japan</h4>
            <hr>
            <blockquote>Just a short ferry ride from mainland Hiroshima is the island of Miyajima, famous the world over as Japan's Shrine Island. Covering an area of 30 square kilometers in Hiroshima Bay, Miyajima is best known as the home of the Itsukushima Shrine, a Shinto temple dedicated to the Princess daughters of the wind god Susanoo. Dating from the eighth century, the majority of the shrine's buildings rise out of the waters of a small bay supported only by piles. The effect at high tide is simply stunning, making these structures - including the famous Great Floating Gate (O-Torii) - appear as if they're floating on water.</blockquote>

            <h4>Mount Fuji, Japan</h4>
            <hr>
            <blockquote>Often capped with snow, Mount Fuji’s gently sloping volcano is Japan’s definition of perfection. Revered by locals, the 12,388-foot summit is open to hikers in certain seasons. Most visitors opt for a sighting, either from Tokyo’s sky-high observation decks or a passing bullet train heading to Osaka. Or, consider a visit to Hakone or Fuji Five Lakes, towns with natural hot springs where you can savor the view – best in early morning or late afternoon, between November and May.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Officially known as "The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World," the copper Lady Liberty was gifted by France as a symbol of friendship and dedicated in 1886. Conserved by the National Park Service, it can be easily seen from the free Staten Island Ferry, but to tour the museum at its base or climb the 377-step spiral staircase into the fascinating crown, you must book ahead with Statue Cruises.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>For centuries the hub of Japanese culture, the lovely unspoiled city of Nara is home to a large number of historic buildings, along with important national treasures and works of art. In addition to its many historic streets, the city boasts numerous important old temples, including the magnificent seventh-century Kofuku-ji Temple, perhaps the best known of the Seven Great Temples of Nara; and the splendid eighth-century Todai-ji (Great East Temple), famous for its huge bronze statue of the Great Buddha (Daibutsu), cast here in AD 749.</blockquote>
